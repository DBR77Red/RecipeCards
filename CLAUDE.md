# RecipeCards — Claude Instructions

## Modal Design Standard

**All modals must use a custom component. Never use `Alert.alert` for user-facing confirmations or action sheets.**

### Spec
| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Background | `#F7F5F2` (warm off-white) |
| Overlay | `rgba(0,0,0,0.65)` |
| Border radius | `24` |
| Padding | `32` |
| Gap | `16` |
| Animation | `Animated.timing` fade + `translateY` slide-in (duration 220ms, `useNativeDriver: true`) |

### Typography
| Role | Font | Size | Color |
|---|---|---|---|
| Title | `PlayfairDisplay_700Bold` | 26 | `#1C1917` |
| Body | `DMSans_400Regular` | 15, lineHeight 24 | `#78716C` |
| Primary btn | `DMSans_600SemiBold` | 15 | `#F7F5F2` |
| Cancel | `DMSans_500Medium` | 14 | `#A8A29E` |

### Buttons
- **Primary**: `backgroundColor: '#1C1917'`, `borderRadius: 100` (pill), `height: 54`, `marginTop: 8`
- **Destructive**: same shape, `backgroundColor: '#DC2626'`
- **Secondary/outline**: same shape, `borderWidth: 1.5`, `borderColor: '#E7E5E4'`, transparent bg
- **Cancel**: plain text, `paddingVertical: 16`, centered — no border, no background

### Reference implementations
- `src/components/PublishConfirmModal.tsx`
- `src/components/PhotoPickerModal.tsx`
- `src/components/DeleteConfirmModal.tsx`

## Typography System

Only these fonts are used. Never use system fonts.

| Token | Family | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Display | `PlayfairDisplay_700Bold` | Screen titles, card titles, modal headings |
| Body regular | `DMSans_400Regular` | Body text, labels, hints |
| Body medium | `DMSans_500Medium` | Navigation, secondary actions |
| Body semibold | `DMSans_600SemiBold` | Buttons, stat values, section headings |

---

## Color Palettes

The app has two palettes. Do not mix them across contexts.

### Screen / UI palette (screens, modals, HomeScreen)
| Name | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| bg | `#F7F5F2` | Screen backgrounds, modal sheets |
| title | `#1C1917` | Primary text, button bg |
| body | `#44403C` | Secondary text |
| muted | `#78716C` | Captions, body in modals |
| label | `#A8A29E` | Placeholder, cancel text |
| divider | `#E7E5E4` | Borders, separators |
| terracotta | `#EA580C` | Active tab, draft badge |
| sage | `#059669` | Published badge |
| btnBg | `#1C1917` | Primary button background |
| btnText | `#F7F5F2` | Primary button text |

### Card palette (RecipeCard component only)
| Name | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| bg | `#fdf8f0` | Card background (cream paper) |
| border | `#e8d5b0` | Card border, dividers |
| amber | `#d4820a` | Accent, stat labels, share button |
| darkText | `#2c1810` | Card titles |
| bodyText | `#5a3e2b` | Card body text |

## Animation Rules

**Never use `useNativeDriver: false`.** All animations must run on the native/UI thread.

- Rotation, opacity, scale, translate → `Animated.spring` or `Animated.timing` with `useNativeDriver: true`
- Height / layout changes → `LayoutAnimation.configureNext` (fires once, native engine) or a plain `setState` snap
- Never animate `height`, `width`, or any layout property with `Animated.Value` + `useNativeDriver: false` — this runs on the JS thread every frame, causes jank, and can crash on low-end devices
- When mixing a `LayoutAnimation` height change with an `Animated` transform on the same render, prefer snapping height instantly (`setState` only, no `LayoutAnimation`) to avoid Android rendering conflicts

---

## RecipeCard Rules

- Card width: always `CARD_W = 320`
- Front height: always `CARD_H_PUB = 720` regardless of draft/published status
- Back height: content-driven — measured via `onLayout`, stored in a `ref` (not state) so `handleFlip` always reads the latest value without stale-closure issues. Minimum clamped to `frontH`.
- **Flip trigger placement**: the flip `Pressable` must only cover the photo zone on the front face, and the entire back face. Never wrap the whole card in a single `Pressable` — it blocks inner button touches (share, publish).
- Both face shells use `pointerEvents="none"` when hidden (opacity 0) to prevent invisible views from intercepting touches.
- Never re-introduce a JS-driver spring on card height — this was the root cause of lag and Android back-face rendering failures.

---

## Navigation

- `headerShown: false` globally — every screen owns its own header UI
- Stack: Home → Form (optional `recipe` param) → Preview (`recipe` param) → CardView (`cardId` param)
- From Preview: if published → `navigation.reset` to Home; if draft → `navigation.goBack()`
- Deep links: `recipecards://card/{id}` → CardView screen
- HomeScreen reloads data via `useFocusEffect` on every focus

---

## Publish Flow

Publish is always two steps. Never block the user on the cloud step.

1. **Local first**: `markPublishedLocally(id)` — sets status, stamps `shareUrl`, QR appears immediately
2. **Cloud async**: `syncToCloud(local)` — uploads photo to Supabase Storage, upserts recipe row. If this fails, show an alert but the card remains published locally and the QR works on the same device.

Always show a `PublishConfirmModal` before triggering publish. Never publish on a single tap without confirmation.

---

## Storage Rules

- `saveDraft(recipe)` returns the saved object with an assigned `id`. Always do `setRecipe(saved)` after calling it — never assume the id is already set.
- `getDrafts()` returns all non-deleted recipes sorted newest first.
- Storage key: `@recipecards/drafts` (AsyncStorage, JSON array of `RecipeData`).

---

## Supabase Rules

- Project URL: `https://hlvaztyvrpyfpgojitvu.supabase.co`
- Client: `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- Table columns are **snake_case** (`creator_name`, `photo_url`, `prep_time`, `cook_time`, `share_url`); TypeScript type uses camelCase
- Photo upload: `recipe-photos` bucket (public), path `{id}.jpg`. Upload the photo **before** upserting the recipe row so `photo_url` is available.
- `CardViewScreen` fetches from Supabase first, falls back to local storage

---

## Performance Rules

- No `useNativeDriver: false` anywhere (see Animation Rules)
- Never put a `ScrollView` inside a component that is itself wrapped in a `Pressable` — scroll gestures will be intercepted by the Pressable
- Both card faces are always mounted (position absolute). Use `pointerEvents="none"` on the hidden face — invisible views still receive touches by default
- Measure back-face height with `onLayout` into a `ref`, not state, to avoid React batching causing stale values at flip time
